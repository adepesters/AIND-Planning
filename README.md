As part of this Udacity AI Nanodegree project, I implement a planning search agent that solves deterministic logistics planning problems defined with PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) for an Air Cargo transport system.

Different uninformed (e.g., breadth-first and depth-first search) and informed search algorithms (e.g., A* algorithm) are implemented, tested and their performance documented.

I also implement a planning graph from which I derive the 'level-sum' heuristic.
